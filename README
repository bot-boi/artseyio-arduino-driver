This is a custom keyboard firmware for the Adafruit Feather nRF52832 LE board, written
with the ARTSEYIO layout in mind. Styled after suckless/dwm.


TODO:
  support right hand layout (just flip lsb)
  generate bindings from the yaml keymap file in the main artseyio repository
  media/fnkey layer
  TAP_DOUBLE(?), TAP_TRIPLE
  change layer while a key is held, return to previous layer on release
  bluetooth keys (disable, reset, pair mode ?)
  send keycodes over USB if bluetooth is disabled
